# Not Everything Needs an App: Tech, Activism, and Touching Grass

## Do We Really Need Another App for That?

Another day, another app claiming to "revolutionize" something. **But do we really need yet another startup trying to "fix" a problem it barely understands?** Tech has given us instant communication, on-demand delivery, and automation, but too often, these so-called "solutions" end up disrupting more than they improve.

Instead of always reaching for code as the answer, maybe it’s time we step outside the tech bubble and engage with real-world activism. **Social movements, labor rights, and grassroots efforts have been making impacts and breakthroughs** long before software engineers started coding solutions. The question is, **where do we stand in the frame?**

## Tech Isn’t Neutral, and Neither are We

There’s a common myth in the industry that **“software is just a tool”**, as if it exists in a bubble, unaffected by, and unaffecting towards societal structures. But the reality is, **If tech is just a tool, why does it keep amplifying the same inequalities it claims to fix?** AI biases, digital redlining, as well as content censorships are just a few of those examples.

Of course, tech has solved real problems, telemedicine, disaster response, and accessibility tools have changed lives. But the difference? **These solutions worked because they started with real-world needs, not just an engineer’s brainstorm session.**

A lot of software engineers including myself enjoy the privileges of working in tech. Good salaries, flexible work, and prestige. But many also benefit from social movements (labor laws, remote work advocacy, better workplace protections) while dismissing the movements advocating for these rights. It’s easy to think we’re above these struggles when we’re not the ones on the frontlines. But **shying away from activism doesn’t make the problems go away**.

## Touch Grass: Understanding the Real World Before Building for It

One of the biggest mistakes in tech? **Designing for people we don’t understand**. Take the case of a startup meant to help small hole-in-the-wall kiosks digitize their businesses. When it's realized the founder never shop at said places they want to help, it became obvious why so many tech solutions fail in the first place.

Real change won’t come from just sitting in your Herman Miller chairs. It starts by stepping outside, talking to people, and actually listening. **It’s not enough to build for them, we need to build with them**. Otherwise, we end up creating products that miss the mark entirely.

## More Than Code: We're All in This Together

No one succeeds alone, and **no one is immune to systemic issues**. Workers in other industries fight for better wages, job security, and fair treatment. But tech professionals often overlook these struggles until they start feeling the impact themselves. When layoffs hit, wages stagnate, or policies shift against workers, it becomes clear that **tech is not as untouchable as it seems. Ignoring these issues today means dealing with their consequences later**.

And here’s what software engineers need to have hammered into our heads: **the best solutions don’t come from tech alone**. We need to work with communities, policymakers, educators, and other experts who actually understand the problems we’re trying to solve. Some of the most impactful tech-driven initiatives didn’t succeed because of brilliant code, **they succeeded because they worked with communities, listened to their needs, and built alongside them**.

So next time you think, "Let’s build an app for that" pause. Who’s already solving this problem? How can you support them instead of disrupting them?

**Because real change isn’t just about innovation, it’s about collaboration.**
