# Not Everything Needs an App: Tech, Activism, and Stepping Outside

## Do We Really Need Another App for That?

Tech has given us faster communication, instant food delivery, and apps for just about everything. But let’s be real, **not every problem needs a software solution**. In fact, sometimes the startups makes things worse by trying to “disrupt” issues it barely understands.

Instead of always reaching for code as the answer, maybe it’s time we step outside the tech bubble and engage with real-world activism. **Social movements, labor rights, and grassroots efforts have been making impacts and breakthroughs** long before software engineers started coding solutions. The question is, **where do we stand in the frame?**

## Tech Isn’t Neutral, and Neither Are We

There’s a common myth in the industry that **“software is just a tool”**, as if it exists in a bubble, unaffected by and unaffecting towards societal structures. But the reality is, **tech reinforces the same inequalities and biases present in the world**.

A lot of software engineers including myself enjoy the privileges of working in tech. Good salaries, flexible work, and prestige. But many also benefit from social movements (labor laws, remote work advocacy, better workplace protections) while dismissing the movements advocating for these rights. It’s easy to think we’re above these struggles when we’re not the ones on the frontlines. But **shying away from activism doesn’t make the problems go away**.

## Touch Grass: Understanding the Real World Before Building for It

One of the biggest mistakes in tech? Designing for people we don’t understand. Take the case of a startup meant to help small hole-in-the-wall kiosks digitize their businesses. When it's realized the founder never shop at said places they want to help, it became obvious why so many tech solutions fail.

If we want to create meaningful change, we have to **step outside** of our Rp10.000.000 ergonomic chairs and interact with the communities we claim to help. **It’s not enough to build for them, we need to build with them**. Otherwise, we end up creating products that miss the mark entirely.

## More Than Code: We're All in This Together

No one succeeds alone, and **no one is immune to systemic issues**. Workers in other industries fight for better wages, job security, and fair treatment, but tech professionals often overlook these struggles until they start feeling the impact themselves. When layoffs hit, wages stagnate, or policies shift against workers, it becomes clear that **tech is not as untouchable as it seems. Ignoring these issues today means dealing with their consequences later**.

And here’s what software engineers need to have hammered down to our heads: **the best solutions don’t come from tech alone**. We need to work with activists, policymakers, educators, and other experts who actually understand the problems we’re trying to solve. Some of the most impactful tech-driven initiatives didn’t succeed because of brilliant code, they succeeded because they worked with communities, listened to their needs, and built alongside them.

Instead of defaulting to “let’s fix this with an app” we should ask, "Who’s already working on this issue? How can we support them?". Because real change isn’t just about innovation, it’s about collaboration.

At the end of the day, the best way to stay grounded is to actually touch grass—and more importantly, connect with the grassroots.
