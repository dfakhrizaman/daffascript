# MVI: The Singleton Pattern That Feels Like Home for React Developers Learning Android

If you're coming from a React or Redux background and starting Android development (using Kotlin and XML, no Jetpack Compose), you might feel like you’ve stepped into a world that still uses adapters, ViewBindings, and a lot of lifecycle boilerplate.

But here’s the good news: **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** is the architectural pattern that will feel the most *familiar* to you, almost like bringing a Redux store into the Android world.

Let’s break down how MVI works in Android and why it clicks so well with React developers.

## React vs MVI (in XML-based Android)

| Concept            | React with Redux                     | Android MVI (Kotlin + XML)               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Component          | Functional/Stateful component         | Activity/Fragment                         |
| View               | JSX rendering                        | XML layout + ViewBinding                 |
| State              | Redux store                          | ViewModel with `StateFlow` or `LiveData` |
| Action/Intent      | `dispatch({ type: 'CLICK' })`         | `sealed class Intent` in Kotlin          |
| Reducer            | `(state, action) => newState`         | `reduce(intent): State` pure function    |
| One source of truth| Redux store                          | Immutable UI state inside ViewModel      |

MVI in Android encourages a **single, immutable state** that gets updated through **pure reducer logic**, which is exactly what you’re used to in Redux.

## The MVI Loop in Android

Here’s the core loop:

```
User Action (Intent) → ViewModel (Reducer) → New State → View Render
```

You capture user actions (like button clicks), send them as *Intents* to a ViewModel, and the ViewModel emits a new *State*. Your UI observes that state and re-renders.

Sound familiar? It should. It’s basically `useReducer` or Redux on Android.

## Example Flow

```kotlin
// Intent
sealed class GameIntent {
    object LoadGames : GameIntent()
    data class SelectGame(val id: String) : GameIntent()
}

// State
data class GameState(
    val isLoading: Boolean = false,
    val games: List<Game> = emptyList(),
    val selectedGame: Game? = null,
    val error: String? = null
)

// Reducer logic in ViewModel
fun reduce(intent: GameIntent) {
    when (intent) {
        is GameIntent.LoadGames -> loadGames()
        is GameIntent.SelectGame -> selectGame(intent.id)
    }
}
```

Then in your `Activity`, you observe state changes and bind the new state to your XML views using ViewBinding.

## Why It Feels Like a Singleton

In MVI, the state lives inside a **ViewModel**, scoped to your screen. It survives configuration changes (like screen rotations), and you always work with **one single state object** at a time.

This central state store behaves like a **scoped singleton**, consistent, reliable, and reactive.

## Benefits for React Devs

- **Familiar unidirectional data flow**  
- **Clear separation of concerns**  
- **Easier debugging** with immutable state  
- **Testable reducer functions**  
- **Lifecycle-safe with ViewModel**

## Tips for Android Dev with XML

- Use **ViewBinding** instead of `findViewById` for safer, cleaner view access.
- Use **StateFlow** in ViewModel to observe state reactively.
- Separate **Intent**, **State**, and **Reducer logic** to keep things modular and testable.

## Final Thoughts

For a React developer, MVI in Android will feel like second nature. Think of the ViewModel as your Redux store, the XML as your JSX, and intents as your dispatches.

The best part? You get all the power of Android’s platform, background services, platform APIs, offline support, while keeping the **predictable state model** you're already comfortable with.


## TLDR

 If you're a React dev diving into Kotlin + XML Android development, MVI is your Redux-friendly architecture that gives you single source of truth, predictable UI, and cleaner logic separation. Welcome home.
